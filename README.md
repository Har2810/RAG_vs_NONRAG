## COMPARISON OF RAG WITH NON RAG

Here we compare the differences in responses when following the RAG approach and a NON RAG approach.
We use a smaller file of 7.8kb here as bigger files would take more time.

##### RAG:

- Get your *Hugging face Api Key* and replace it in the code file

- Get your *Google AI studio Api Key* and replace it in the code file

- Update the file path variable in the code with the path of your text file.

- Run the program using:

```
$ python RAG_small_file.py
```

##### NON RAG / Direct:

- Get your *Google AI studio Api Key* and replace it in the code file

- Run the program using:

```
$ python Direct_small_file.py
```
